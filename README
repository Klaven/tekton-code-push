# Goal of Project

Developers shouldn't need to know kubectl just to do developement on Kubernetes. 
They should be able to push their code and have it get built and run by the platform.

# Installation

I don't have a helm chart yet but installation isn't too hard. I'll fully write these out next time I reset my cluster.

- Install an ingress controller if your cluster doesn't already have one
- Install Minio (or other S3 compatible object store). Doesn't need to be in the cluster
- Install Tekton 
- Install Tekton triggers
- Install Tekton Dashboard
- Install loki-stack into the loki namespace
- `kubectl apply -f` all the files in tektonyaml/
- Create a secret to allow pushing built images `kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml create secret docker-registry registry-creds --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<username> --docker-password <password> --docker-email <email>`
- Edit this secret to change the data key to be from `.dockerconfigjson` to be `config.json` (or duplicate the key)
- mv upload.sh to someplace in your $PATH


# Immediate Next Steps

- Add manifest.yml parsing
- Add svccat integration
- Add helm chart
- Improve logging & add annotation to deployed objects
- Rewrite upload script into python
- Refactor node.js code and improve websocket handling
- Add delete functionality (not sure best way...)
- Auth/Multitenancy?
